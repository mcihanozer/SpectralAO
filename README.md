People of Earth!

Wait for it!

Summary:

* An application focuses on Geometry processing + Manifold Harmonics + Ambient Occlusion:
  - You can load your mesh (limited support)
  - Calculate harmonic bases of the mesh
  - Smooth the mesh geometry or ambient occlusion of the mesh
* Related with my thesis
* Based on libigl: https://github.com/libigl/libigl
* GitHub Page: SpectralAO (Not the latest version, not the best version…
  I still have the latest and best version on my local –Sorry!)
